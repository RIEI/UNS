Things you will need
---------------------
HTTP Server ( IIS or Apache)
MySQL 5
PHP 5 (XML, LDAP [optional] )
PHPmyadmin (for easy MySQL management, not really needed, just useful)
A Browser ( ie Firefox, Chrome, or IE if you really wanted to)

Instructions
---------------------
I am assuming that you already have your SQL server and HTTP server with PHP set up and working.

The installer is working, I suggest you use that. http://[uns path]/install.php

If you really really know what you are doing, you can take the setup.sql file to create the tables,
but you will also need create the conn.php and var.php files in configs/. you will also need to setup
the UNS sql user. The setup.sql file is used in the instillation, so dont modify it either unless you 
know what you are doing, or just want to hack around.

If you want to have just your admin folder ssl'd, there is an example apache config file in the configs folder.
As for IIS, google and a few clicks of the mouse, should give you the same thing.

LEDs
---------------------
If you are using linux and have uns running on a physical machine, you can use the LPT code to have some LEDs blink.
lpt is to set the values on the parallel port
portctl is to read the value of the parallel port, it is optional, not used by UNS, just for debuging and development of the code.

Compiling LED binaries:
  [not-uns]# cd [uns]/bin/
  [uns]/bin# make
  [uns]/bin# make install

Finally run your respective rc-update command so it runs on startup.
This is needed so on boot all LEDs attached to the LPT port are turned off, unless your LEDs are off by default, mine are not, so I need this init script.
If you did a manual build and copy to a different location then where the makefile puts the, you will need to modify the init.d script.

If you have your LEDs being driven by a logical high on the LPT port then you will either need to reverse the LEDs to be driven by a logic low, or modify
the source code in shared.php so that it does the opposite of what it does now
