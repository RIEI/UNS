Things you will need
---------------------
HTTP Server ( ie IIS or Apache)
MySQL 5
PHP 5
PHPmyadmin (for easy MySQL management)
A Browser ( ie Firefox or Chrome)


Instructions
---------------------
I am assuming that you already have your SQL server and HTTP server with PHP set up and working.

    Step 1
Insert setup.sql into your database (this will create the UNS DB and all the tables)

    Step 2
Create a MySQL user for UNS to connect with.
Permissions needed are all (minus grant) for the UNS database and none for global.

    Step 3
Edit the config/conn.php file
*See file for details*

    Step 4
Edit the config/vars.php file
*See file for details*

    Step 5
Login with the default User of UNS_Admin
Password UNS_Pass
Add more users and disable the built-in Admin.

    Step 6
Add Viewing Clients and set them up as you like.
