  Summary:
		UNS is a PHP and MySQL based set of scripts that is intended to manage and
		show messages and web pages on Area Displays. With the ability to enable 
		emergency messages globaly, or have unique lists of URLS for each display.
		
		Client computers connect with a web browser to the server and get a web page 
		that has been configured for that client. So on the server say you set up a 
		client for the Front Lobby and add URLs to the companies homepage, some news 
		sites that relate to the company, weather, or you can make custom pages 
		(todays lunch menu, RSS feed view (area news or School news), or Images 
		(marketing). There is an Emergency Mode that overrides all the clients and 
		displays the current Emergency Message. (IE Intruder in the building lock all 
		doors, or a Fire in a building and show the escape route.)
